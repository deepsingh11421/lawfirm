                <p class="text-justify text-pad">Matrimonial Disputes - With changing times, matrimonial disputes are on
                    rise.
                    Disintegration of joint families, erosion of social values, loosening of moral fabric, financial
                    independence
                    of modern women have all led to innumerable matrimonial disputes arising in Indian families. It
                    requires a
                    comprehensive understanding of the entire law which may affect the matrimonial disputes in any
                    manner.
                    Matrimonial disputes under the Indian legal system are very complicated and cumbersome. The
                    matrimonial
                    disputes may be due to any reason but it culminates into civil as well as criminal proceedings.
                    Since the
                    matrimonial disputes have very wide ranging effects on the spouse, one needs the services of highly
                    trained
                    and qualified lawyer to handle the matrimonial disputes. The civil proceedings in the matrimonial
                    disputes are
                    the proceedings for grant of divorce, permanent alimony, maintenance, restitution of conjugal rights
                    etc.
                    whereas the criminal proceedings in matrimonial disputes can be proceedings under the anti dowry
                    laws for
                    prosecution of the husband under Section 498A, 406 IPC. Proceedings under section 125 of Crpc ,
                    proceedings
                    under the Domestic Violence Act etc. <br><br>
                    Family Disputes - Many families with conflicts that require a legal resolution want to stay out of
                    court. This
                    can be especially important if there are children involved. For that reason, family law attorneys
                    also use ADR
                    to help their clients resolve disputes. The use of ADR in family law disputes (as well as other
                    types of
                    disputes) may also be called "collaborative law." Courts that use ADR to resolve family law disputes
                    are also
                    sometimes known as "conciliation courts".When you and your partner separate, you will have to deal
                    with
                    several legal issues. Negotiation, mediation and arbitration are different types of ADR. You cannot
                    be forced
                    into ADR for a family law case. You and your former partner must choose it freely. If you are
                    thinking about
                    using ADR, talk to a lawyer. If you do not, you may give up rights that you do not know you have.
