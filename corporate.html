                <p class="text-justify text-pad">Protecting and managing intellectual property rights (IPR) is the first step for any business seeking to establish its presence in India, and must be incorporated as an integral part of the business asset growth strategy.
                    Having a distinguished intellectual property can set your business apart from competitors, and become an essential part of your marketing. An intellectual property can also be sold or licensed to generate revenues for you or your business.
                    In India, there are different types of intellectual property, which are protected under separate laws. As a result, registering intellectual property involves navigating complex legalities and submitting numerous documents. This requires expertise and familiarity with procedural norms to ensure fast and effective registration.
